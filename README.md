# Big_DRSSTC_Gate_Drive_PCBA
PCBA for gate drive connections to 2x IGBT brick bridges for my 160mm DRSSTC

This board is designed to go with my IGBT brick bridge PCBA (see my other repo), but will work with any IGBTs that have the same gate connections.

Separate Ron and Roff paths are provided, along with provision for a TVS to protect the gate and a couple of different connection options. The most useful is probably the screw terminals, but I have added a ribbon cable connection to accomodate one of my other designs which uses this for low-inductance remote gate connections.

Note: See Manufacturing/Reference output folders for gerbers, schematic PDFs, STEP files etc.
